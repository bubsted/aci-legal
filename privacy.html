  <h1>Privacy Policy</h1>
  <p><strong>Agricultural Construction, Inc.</strong><br>
  Last updated: February 18, 2026</p>

  <h2>1. Overview</h2>
  <p>This Privacy Policy describes how Agricultural Construction, Inc. ("Company," "we," "us," or "our") handles information in connection with our internal point-of-sale application ("Application"). This Application is used exclusively for internal business operations and is not available to the general public.</p>

  <h2>2. Information We Access</h2>
  <p>The Application connects to QuickBooks Online via Intuit's API to access the following business data for internal operational purposes:</p>
  <ul>
    <li>Product and inventory information</li>
    <li>Sales invoice data</li>
    <li>QuickBooks account credentials (handled entirely through Intuit's secure OAuth process)</li>
  </ul>

  <h2>3. How We Use Information</h2>
  <p>Data accessed through the Application is used solely to operate our internal retail point-of-sale system — specifically to look up products, process sales transactions, and create invoices in QuickBooks Online. We do not use this data for any other purpose.</p>

  <h2>4. Data Sharing</h2>
  <p>We do not sell, share, rent, or disclose any business or customer data accessed through this Application to any third parties. All data remains within Agricultural Construction, Inc.'s internal systems and QuickBooks Online.</p>

  <h2>5. Data Storage</h2>
  <p>The Application runs on internal company hardware. QuickBooks data is accessed in real time via Intuit's API and is not stored independently by this Application beyond temporary session use.</p>

  <h2>6. QuickBooks / Intuit</h2>
  <p>Authentication with QuickBooks Online is handled through Intuit's OAuth 2.0 system. We do not store your QuickBooks username or password. Intuit's own Privacy Policy governs how Intuit handles your data. You can review it at <a href="https://www.intuit.com/privacy/statement/">intuit.com/privacy/statement</a>.</p>

  <h2>7. Security</h2>
  <p>Access to the Application is restricted to authorized employees of Agricultural Construction, Inc. We use HTTPS for all communications between the Application and QuickBooks Online.</p>

  <h2>8. Changes to This Policy</h2>
  <p>We may update this Privacy Policy as needed. Any changes will be reflected with an updated date at the top of this page.</p>
